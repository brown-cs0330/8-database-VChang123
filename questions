Questions

1. Consider the thread created in start_listener. 
How many threads with this functionality should be running on the server at any given time?

    There should only be one thread with the listening functionality becuase when you are 
    creating new client threads they should not have this functionality becuase they only 
    want to execute what the client wants them to do. Not listen for new clients.

2. In the listener function, what do each of the following fields of the 
sockaddr_in struct represent: sin_family, sin_port, and sin_addr.s_addr?

    sin_family: Represents the Internet protocol that is being used. So in start_listener the sin_family
        is AF_INET which is IPv4.
    sin_port: Gets the port of the server and converts it from host to network(short). 
        So in start_listener the sin_port = htons(comm_port);
    sin_addr.s_addr: stores all the address on the machine becuase a machine might have
        mutiple address. It stores the "wildcard" address which is all the address on the machine. 
        In start_listener the sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY). htonl means convert from host to network
        long.

3. What is the purpose of each of the following function calls in listener: 
socket, bind, listen, and accept? You should explain what each call does and 
what the effect would be if it were not called.

    socket: Sockets are the abstraction of the communication path or a communication endpoing.
        socket() sets up a socket which is the basis for communication and
        refers to it using a file descriptor. If this function were not called then
        there would not be an endpoint fo commuication and the server would not be 
        able to communicate with another network.

    bind: The bind function binds the file descriptor returned by socket() to the address
        returned by getaddrinfo(). If the file descriptor is not binded to a an address then
        there is not a specified place for a server port to be open. Binding to and address
        defines exactly which interface should have that serve port open. Binding to a
        specific address makes the server port only visible to the network connected to the local host.
    
    listen: The listen function tells the Operating System that the process would like to 
        receive connections from clients using the indicated socket. The first parameter is a 
        socket file descriptor, and the second parameter is the maximum number of connections that may 
        be queued up. If the listner function is not called then the socket will not be able access
        clients using the indicated socket.

    accept: The accept system call waits if necessary for a connected socket to appear on the
        the listening socket's queue, then pulls the first such socket from the queue. This socket
        is the server end of a connection from a client. A file descriptor is returned that refers
        to that socket, alloding the process to now communicate withe communicate. If accept is not
        used then the process would not be able to communicate with the client.

4. Which protocol (TCP or UDP) is used for communication? 
Why is this protocol used? (Hint: see line 35 in comm.c)

    The protocol used for communication is UDP because (AF_INET) over IPv4 means UDP.
    UDP is a datagram and uses unreliable communication. Therefore it is better and faster than TCP.
    UDP prioritizes speed over quality becuase sometimes packets are lost. But in Database speed 
    is important becuase we want to create an efficient program that extracts data from
    the Database effieciently.

5. Describe what comm_serve does. How are the response and 
command parameters used? What would happen if the stream pointed to by cxstr were closed?

    comm_serve is in charge of the communication. It writes in the response to the file using fputs(). 
    Then using fgets(), it reads in the file csxtr specified and stores it in command. The 
    response and command parameters are used to store characters or messages wanting to be 
    sent across networks. If the stream pointed to by csxtr were closed then response and
    command would not have anything to read to or write from, therefore the client connection
    would be terminated.


6. Describe, in detail, what happens during each iteration of 
the while loop in the listener function. Be sure to include explanations of all 
significant function calls.

    Each iteration the first function call is accept() which waits to see if there is a client 
    socket waiting to be connected. If there is, then that socket is pulled and a connection is created.
    If there is no sockets in the queue the the while loop ends and the function returns NULL. 
    If a connection has been made then a file is created and using fdopen(csock, "w+") give it 
    write permission. Then the call to server() establishes a client which has I/O stream pointed to by cxstr. 
    Then the while loop continues until there is no more sockets left in the queue.
